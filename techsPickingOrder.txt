#If all techs listed here are built, should the ai use it's own tech logic ?
useDefaultTechPlanWhenEmpty=True

#After all settings, the techs list begins :
#Put the id of the tech to research on each line

# First rush small cargo
# Energy level 1
113
# Combustion level 2
115:2

#Then rush colony ships
# Espionage level 3
106:3
# Impulsion propulsion level 3
117:3
# Astrophysic level 1
124

# Then take 2 level in computer to evade while colonizing and making expeditions
# Computer to level 2
108:2

# Then take the techs for large cargo
# Combustion from 2 to 6
115:4

# Then take the techs for small laser to be able to dump remaining crystal in case of an attack
# Energy from 1 to 2
113

# Laser to level 3
120:3

# Then take 2 more levels in Astrophysic
# Astrophysic from 1 to 3
124:2

# Then take 1 more level in computer to evade while colonizing and making expeditions
# Computer from 2 to 3
108

# Finally unlock the resources production upgrade tech
# Energy from 2 to 5
113:3

# Then we can fallback to the ai own logic (hopefully)
